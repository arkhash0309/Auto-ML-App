<h1>Auto-ML-App</h1>
<h2>This project involves the implementation of a web application to make use of Automated Machine Learning.</h2>

<h2>The libraries used in this project were:</h2>
<li> Python</li>
<li>Pandas Profiling</li>
<li>PyCaret</li>
<li>Streamlit</li>

<h2>Steps followed:</h2>
<li>The necessary libraries were imported.</li>
<li>The streamlit app is built with its features.</li>
<li>The app is tested by uploading the dataset into the web app.</li>

<h2>Sections of the web application:</h2>
<li>Upload: Allows the user to upload the dataset</li>
<li>Profiling: Performs Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the dataset</li>
<li>Modelling: Allows the user to select the target column and perform the model training.</li>
<li>Download: Allows the user to download the optimal model.</li>

<h3>The cool part about this application is that it automatically chooses the most efficient and optimal model with the best hyperparameters.</h3>

<p>Make sure to use python 3.10 or less, else might face issues in the installation of pycaret.</p>
